## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was my first JavaScript project and it took some time to understand the concept and how to add the event listeners to the ratings and submit button but after some YouTube videos and practice. I finally understood how to get the code working.

### Continued development

I will like to continue learning how to manipulation the DOM, and other basic JavaScript functions
